ChatGPT: Please explain "process" and "thread" to a construction worker


“线程”与“函数调用”有某种类似性


多线程类似于孙悟空的分身术，变出好多个自己，一个去打妖怪，一个去救师傅，。。。。

## Please give me some code demo of concurrency  -> google gemini

use std::thread;

fn fetch_data(url: &str) -> String {
  // Simulate downloading data (replace with actual network calls in real applications)
  println!("Downloading data from {}", url);
  thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
  format!("Data from {}", url)
}

fn main() {
  let url1 = "https://www.example.com/data1";
  let url2 = "https://www.example.com/data2";

  // Spawn new threads to fetch data concurrently
  let thread1 = thread::spawn(move || fetch_data(url1));
  let thread2 = thread::spawn(move || fetch_data(url2));

  // Wait for both threads to finish and get their results
  let data1 = thread1.join().unwrap();
  let data2 = thread2.join().unwrap();

  println!("Fetched data: {}", data1);
  println!("Fetched data: {}", data2);
}
